Cinematic camera
****************

Since version ``1.5.0`` a new option is available in the user interface to control the behaviour of the camera, the cinematic mode toggle. The cinematic mode is in fact the same exact behaviour
the camera has had in Gaia Sky since the first release. If cinematic mode is not enabled, however, the camera adopts a new behaviour which is much more responsive.

Cinematic behaviour
===================

This behaviour makes the camera use **acceleration and momentum**, leading to **very smooth transitions** and movements. This is the ideal camera to 
use when recording camera paths or when showcasing to an audience.

.. _noncinematic-behaviour:

Non-cinematic behaviour
=======================

In this behaviour the camera becomes much **more responsive** to the user's commands and inputs. There is no longer an acceleration factor, and momentum is very minimal. This is the
**default** behaviour as of version ``1.5.0`` and probably better meets the expectations of new users.
