Gaia Sky VR
***********

There is currently a development version of Gaia Sky which uses OpenVR to output to VR headsets that support that API. For more information on how to get it up and running, visit the ``README.md`` file `here <https://github.com/langurmonkey/gaiasky/blob/vr/README.md>`__ in the ``vr`` branch.
